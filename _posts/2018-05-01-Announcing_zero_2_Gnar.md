When we first started working on this project, the initial goal was to simply capture a year or two's worth of fun and skating with friends. Pushing one's self to go out and film is not only a catlyst for progression, it's also a great way to enjoy a fulfilling life. Although I'm about to be 30 and have been skating for over 25 years, I still get a kick out of being able to reminisce on how a friend landed a certain trick, seeing way's that we've progressed over time, or being reminded of what a fun session we had, months after the fact. It never gets old; however, unfortunately, we all do.

> "blowing out my knee a few years back quickly brought me to the tragic realization that my limbs aren't going to work like they do for much longer, so to make the most out of the time I have left skating, became obesessed with dedicating all of my free time to skating and filming a full length."

For many, the soul-crushing reality of a 9-5 is a death-sentance to the child within, along with any sort of passion that may have once existed. I too have felt the walls closing in; my aging joints taunt daily that "nobody gets to skate forever", and you've got to pay to play. Furthermore, blowing out my knee a few years back (tibio-fibular joint, technically, but whatever) quickly brought me to the tragic realization that my limbs aren't going to work like they do for much longer, so to make the most out of the time I have left skating, became obesessed with dedicating all of my free time to skating and filming a full length.

Many of the skaters I see today are quick to 'throw away' their footy out into the instagram abyss on a clip by clip basis. I fail to see the fun in collecting likes and comments in exchange "cyber klout". It's a rareity to find a crew that's charging out into the wild and stockpiling clips on a weekly basis, and I'm so stoked that the Z2G crew has been willing to dedicate their weekends to this project. As cliche as it sounds, this literally has become a way of life for us, to the point of where (most of us) have moved in together. Hoping that ultimately this kind of project will lead us along to the path of moentization where we can drink from the fountain of opportunity.

## Coming soon: Zero 2 Gnar
Premiering at Red Curbs Skate Shop in Fremont, CA, Zero 2 Gnar is a full-length skate film featuring parts by Ty Stone, Julian Gibson, Ted Lee, Malik Barnett and several mystery guests. Primarily filmed in Oakland, CA, the crew traveled as far as Lincoln City, OR, in search of crossing items off our hitlist. Countless beers, boards, bummers and bowls later, we're getting closer to being able to share our adventures with the rest of the world. Stay tuned...
